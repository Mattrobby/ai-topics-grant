## ToDo Items: 

### Smoothing the Graph & Finding Meaningful Tags

- [ ] *Liner Regression* for each tag's frequency (**NOTE:** Read *Liner Regression* section in book) 
- [ ] If $r^2 > 0.7$ the it is increasing or decreasing 
- [ ] What are the most increasing? - *probably the most and least increasing tags* (**NOTE:** make sure that it is a dramtic increase, not from 0 to 1
- [ ] Be able to filter data by a time range 
	- [ ] Graph most dramatic rise and fall

### Filter by Source 

- [ ] Plot the increase and decrease based on source (change the `filter` tag)
	- Go to [AI Topics](https://aitopics.org) and look at the *theme* filter
	- Are there tags growing in *archive.org* but not *news*? 
- [ ] Write a method that takes a `URL` from an AI Topics search and use that for my program
